# Java-Program
  This is a simple game I made for a Java class years ago. The idea is to move around a grid/dungeon collecting loot. The original idea was a field collecting daisies.
# things to fix
  renaming functions from daisies to loot
  fix the rounding error when gathering loot
# things to add maybe?
  In the future I would like to improve this game, maybe add some puzzles to solve or monsters to fight.
